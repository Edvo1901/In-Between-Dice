# In-Between-Dice (Edward Vo)
This script is to simulate three 12 sided dice in order to play the game of In-Between with dice (the face value on each die 
is  1  –  12  inclusive). Two dice are rolled,  the  player  then  bets  whether  the  third  die  rolled  will  numerically  fall  in 
between the first two dice rolled.  If the player wins (that is, the third die rolled falls numerically in between  the first two 
dice rolled), the player collects the bet amount, if the player loses (that is, the third die rolled falls numerically outside 
the first two dice rolled), the player loses the bet amount.  You will be betting with chips (not the edible kind)  – you will 
start with 100 chips.

## Game play and rules: 
1. To begin, two 12-sided dice are rolled (the face value on the dice are 1 – 12 inclusive). 
2. Before any more die are rolled, the player then bets from nothing (zero) to however many chips they currently 
have (starting chip  amount is 100)  whether  or  not the third die rolled  will numerically fall  in between the first 
two rolled. 
3. If the third die rolled numerically falls in between the first two rolled, the player wins and the player’s bank 
balance will be increased by the amount of chips bet. 
4. If the third die rolled numerically falls outside of the first two rolled, the player loses and the player’s bank 
balance will be decreased by the amount of chips bet. 
5. If the third die rolled is the same as one of the first two rolled, (for example: if the player has a 3 and 8, and 
the third die rolled is another 3), the player has ‘hit the post’ and loses the bet amount from their current chip 
balance. 
6. If the two dice rolled at the start of the game have the same face value, (for example: two 5s are rolled), no 
further  game  play  is  required  for  that  round  and  the  player  may  choose  whether  to  play  again  or  not.    This 
does not change the player’s chip balance in any way.
